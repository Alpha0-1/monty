0x19. C - Stacks, Queues - LIFO, FIFO
In Python, stacks and queues are fundamental data structures used to organize and manage collections of elements.

Stacks:

Follow the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle.
Elements are added and removed from the same end, known as the "top" of the stack.
Common operations include push (addition) and pop (removal).
Queues:

Follow the First In, First Out (FIFO) principle.
Elements are added at one end, known as the "rear" or "enqueue," and removed from the other end, known as the "front" or "dequeue."
Common operations include enqueue (addition) and dequeue (removal).
Both stacks and queues have various applications in solving problems related to data processing, algorithm design, and memory management. They are implemented in Python using built-in data structures or can be created using lists, collections, or custom classes.
